# Exercise 2 Data
## Clean data and preprocessing
- No 'Nan' data in frames
- Unecessary data should be removed from `data`
- Remove duplicate columns.
- Have index column -- `second_elapsed`
- Remove duplicate columns
- Combine dataframes
- Merge all csv in folders
# Exercise 4: K-means algorithm
Unsupervised machine learning problems are problems in which we try to determine some particular structure within a data set. We are interesting in making sense of the data in grouping this data, without knowing beforehand which and how many groups exist.
## *The K-means algorithm* From D-dimension data to K-group clusters.
These clusters can each be characterized by their mean vector.
*Mean vector* : the center of the $k^{th}$ cluster, a column vector $\mu^{(k)}$.

$\mu^{(k)} = [\mu_1^{(k),\mu_2^{(k),\mu_3^{(k)\dots,\mu_D^{(k)}$
